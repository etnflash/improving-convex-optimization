## Features

- **Clean Landing Page**: Welcome section, getting started guide, and about information
- **Navigation Bar**: Sticky navigation with Home, Topics, and About links
- **Responsive Design**: Mobile-first design that adapts to different screen sizes
- **MathJax Support**: Renders mathematical equations beautifully
- **Educational Content**: 
  - "What is a Convex Set?" with formal definition
  - Detailed example: Unit Ball in ℝ²
  - Properties and common examples of convex sets
  - Diagram placeholders for future visual illustrations

## Getting Started

1. Open `index.html` in a web browser to view the website
2. Navigate to Topics to learn about convexity
3. All content is static HTML/CSS - no build process required

## Future Expansion

The structure is ready for:
- Interactive demonstrations and visualizations
- Additional topic pages (convex functions, optimization algorithms, etc.)
- Custom JavaScript for interactive examples
- Diagrams and illustrations in the `images/` folder
